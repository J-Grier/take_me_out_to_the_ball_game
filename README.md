# Bayesian OPS+ Forecasting for Baseball Players

This project implements a probabilistic model for predicting player-level OPS+ using rolling Statcast and performance features. The model is built for practical baseball applications such as trade evaluation, matchup planning, and scouting decisions.

## 🔍 Project Objective
To build a **Bayesian forecasting model** that:
- Predicts player OPS+ with uncertainty intervals
- Incorporates rolling monthly metrics and Statcast data
- Provides interpretable, variance-aware forecasts
- Supports use cases like **trade decisions** and **game-by-game scouting**

## ⚾ Key Features
- **Rolling 3-day and 100-day anchors**: Capture short- and long-term trends
- **Delta features**: Track deviations in xwOBA and launch speed vs baseline
- **Hierarchical Bayesian Model (Pyro)**: Predicts OPS+ with 95% credible intervals
- **CI Coverage Evaluation**: Achieved ~72% coverage for 95% CI
- **Model is robust to sparse data**, can be adapted for partial seasons or injury-recovery cases

## 🛠️ Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and rolls monthly-level performance and Statcast data
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Rolling OPS, xwOBA, launch speed
   - Player-specific baselines and deltas
3. **Modeling**:
   - Bayesian Neural Network with Pyro
   - v1 prediction used as prior anchor
   - Full posterior predictive sampling
4. **Evaluation**:
   - RMSE and CI coverage against test season (2022 held out)
   - Visualized residuals and top-25 predictions

## 💡 Use Cases
- **Trade Valuation**: Estimate future offensive contribution of trade targets
- **Scouting Decisions**: Prioritize call-ups or platoon usage based on predictive confidence
- **Matchup Planning**: Align lineups around short-term hot/cold indicators

## 📂 File Structure
- `/data/` – Cleav5_predictions.csv contains monthly OPS+ predictions with 95% confidence intervals and full input features for each MLB hitter-seasonned and raw player performance & Statcast data
- `/models/` – available on request
- `/plots/` – Visuals of prediction intervals and coverage

## 🚧 Limitations
- Players with too little data (e.g. injured stars) may be excluded unless specifically recovered
- Model assumes monthly aggregation — can be adapted to game-level with daily anchoring

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Incorporate pitcher-adjusted context for matchup-specific forecasts
- Add injury, age, or team effect priors
- Expand to multi-output predictions (e.g., OBP, SLG separately)
